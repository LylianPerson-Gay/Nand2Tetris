# Nand2Tetris
My job for the Nand2Tetris project  
Here is also my notes and helpfull tutorials, enjoy ! 

## Project 01 : Boolean Algebra

\* is for And  
\+ is for Or  
' is for Not

### Boolean Identities

* Identity				a + 0 = a  
						a * 1 = a  
* Forgot the name		a + 1 = 1  
						a * 0 = 0  
* Idempotence			a + a = a  
						a * a = a  
* Complementation		a + a' = a  
						a * a' = 0  
* Distributivity		a + (b * c) = (a + b) * (a + c)  
						a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)  
* Associativity			a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c = a + b + c  
						a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c = a * b * c  
* De Morgan's Laws		(a * b)' = a' + b'  
						(a + b)' = a' * b'  
* Others				a'' = a 		a + (a * b) = a  
						a + (a' * b) = a + b  
						a * (a + b) = a  
						(a + b) * (a + b') = a
